### Smiley Dataset (`smiley_X.npy`, `smiley_y.npy`)  

Contains 9x9 images of smiley faces. Pixel values are represented as 0 or 1.  
144 samples, 81 features, 2 classes.  
Used in labs 8-10.  

### Modified Smiley Dataset (`smiley_X_new.npy`, `smiley_y_new.npy`)    

Similar to the Smiley dataset but includes more variation in faces.  
9120 samples, 81 features, 2 classes.
